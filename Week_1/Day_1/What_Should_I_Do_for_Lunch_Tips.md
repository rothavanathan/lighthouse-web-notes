### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```

const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  if (!hungry) {
    console.log("Get back to work!");
  } else {
    if (availableTime < 20) {
      console.log("Eep! Pick something up and eat it in the lab.");
    } else if (availableTime >= 20 && availableTime < 30) {
      console.log("LUXURIOUS! Try a place nearby.");
    } else if (availableTime >= 30) {
      console.log("You're in a web dev bootcamp. You don't have that much available time. STOP LYING TO YOURSELF.");
    }
  }
};
```
